# ðŸŽ“ University Admission Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project utilizes **Machine Learning** to predict the likelihood of a studentâ€™s admission to a university. The prediction is based on several key factors such as **CGPA, GRE Score, TOEFL Score, Research Papers Published, Letters of Recommendation (LORs)**, and more. By analyzing these factors, the model provides an estimate of admission probability to help students evaluate their chances.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and prepared the dataset to handle missing values, outliers, and standardize features.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Performed EDA to uncover insights and relationships between admission factors.
- **Model Building**: Implemented various regression algorithms including:
  - **Linear Regression**
  - **Ridge Regression**
  - **Lasso Regression**
  - **Elastic Net**
- **Model Evaluation**: Compared models using performance metrics like RÂ² score, Mean Absolute Error (MAE), and Mean Squared Error (MSE) to select the best one for accurate predictions.
  
## Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Algorithms**: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, Elastic Net

## Project Setup
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/university-admission-prediction.git
    ```
2. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Run the project:
    ```bash
    python admission_prediction.py
    ```

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains features like **CGPA**, **GRE Score**, **TOEFL Score**, and other admission-related factors. This data is preprocessed for optimal model performance.

## Results
After experimenting with various models, the best performing algorithm was selected based on its ability to make accurate predictions about a studentâ€™s chances of admission.

# University-Admission-Prediction

In this project, I built a machine learning model to predict student admission probability based on factors like CGPA, GRE Score , TOEFL Score, number of research papers published, number of letters of recommendation (LORs) and other such factors. 

Using Python, I handled data preprocessing, Exploratory Data Analysis and experimented with algorithms like linear regression, Ridge regression , lasso regression and Elastic Net. After evaluating performance metrics, I selected the best model to provide accurate predictions.
